# hhtp_server
Project for 4C strategies

1. Start Server
   a) Define port number (for example 1078), in console
   b) Define root file name (for example C:\User\Hulda
3. Start Client
   a) Define port number, again.
   b) Define root file name, again.
4. Now you can define which files you want to look for, but execute only at your own risk. (The server is looping a message)
5. Look in console of the client, as you can see the server finds the file (but I was not able to figure out how to actually download the files).
